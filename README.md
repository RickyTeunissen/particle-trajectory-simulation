# particle-trajectory-simulation

The code within this repository has been written as part of the course Physics in Perspective at the Technical University of Eindhoven. 
Using the python code in a jupyter notebook, it is possible to plot the trajectory of any particle of a given radius and velocity as it moves through a set of force fields which will be defined one by one within the code. The code will take the user step by step through how it does this for people who are interested in how it works. People who are not, can simply run all the cells in the entire file at once. It is recommended to also look at the report it is based on, since this explains most of the decisions taken into the report. 

If you are interested in the report or have discovered a bug, please contact the author via email: r.m.p.teunissen@student.tue.nl
